## Project Description 
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters in a message or data stream based on their 
frequency of occurrence. The most frequent characters are assigned the shortest codes, and the least frequent characters are assigned the longest codes. 
This results in a more efficient use of storage space, as the most frequently occurring characters take up less space than the less frequently 
occurring characters. The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman in 1951.

  > ## How to run it? 
g++ main.cpp Huffman.cpp Node.cpp -o run
./run computer.txt

You can try to use any text file you want to run it with any text file you want just:
g++ main.cpp Huffman.cpp Node.cpp -o run
./run <THE_NAME_OF_THE_TXT_FILE_YOU_WANT>
